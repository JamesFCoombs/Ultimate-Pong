This project started off as my AP Computer Science self-directed final project.
Occasionally, I return and add on to it, making it better.

The project currently has a fully functioning pong game with fun colors and
animations, as well as the capacity for
-multiplayer
-singlerplayer vs ai
-multiple balls spawning in (with collisions)
-main menu, game screen, end game, help screen, player selection
